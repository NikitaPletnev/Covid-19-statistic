## Description

The application made using React, Material UI, Redux and Echarts. 
I did not have time to add tests but if I did them, I would do them on Jest.

This is a simple application that uses the coronavirus statistics API (https://covid19.mathdro.id/api) 
and displays data from it. 
Not everything turned out to be done the way it was in the layout attached to the task,
because data cannot always be interpreted as it should be, 
so that it is like on the layout (in the chart element). 
 
I managed to make some elements even better than they were on the layout, in my opinion.
I added the ability to filter and sort all the columns in the table and
added a more convenient chart with the ability to select multiple countries. 
 
Maybe I didn't fully test the applications for adaptability, 
but it seems to work and look good on mobile devices.
